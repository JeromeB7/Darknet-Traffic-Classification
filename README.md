# Darknet-Traffic-Classification
This study investigates the classification of Darknet traffic using machine learning models and the impact of adversarial attacks on their performance. The CIC-Darknet2020 dataset is used to train various classifiers, including Random Forest and XGBoost, to differentiate between Tor, VPN, and non-anonymous traffic while also categorizing traffic into applications such as chat, email, and file transfer. Due to the dataset's imbalance, the study applies the SMOTE oversampling technique to improve model performance. Random Forest and XGBoost achieve the highest F1-scores, with XGBoost slightly outperforming for traffic classification and Random Forest performing better for application classification.

To evaluate the robustness of these models, adversarial attacks are simulated by obfuscating 20% of the dataset's features, significantly degrading classification accuracy. The study finds that training models with partially obfuscated data can mitigate attack effects, with Random Forest demonstrating better resilience than XGBoost. The research suggests that future work should explore real-time Darknet traffic classification, extend adversarial attack simulations to other models, and incorporate deep learning approaches to improve robustness against adversarial manipulations.
